# Some not too complex thoughts about complexity :)

## Structural Quality

COMPLEXITY is a quality inherent of a system: talks about the system’s structure.
- A system is more or less complex or simple;
- omplexity is a function of the number of components and the number of relationships among components.
- Ok, ok, I know, it is not that simple :)
- ...  actually, the semantics of the relationships increases/decreases a system’s complexity)

## Operational quality
Operational quality refers to the way the system operates at execution time and in the real world.

Operational means many (non exclusive) dimensions like:
- Buildability or how complicated or straightforward is to build a complex or simple the system; 
- Understandability or how simple or complicated to understand a system is;
- Modifiability and how complicated or simple is to change the system structure;  
- even you can think on Performance and how the system behaves; not only software system performas bad or well, but also human systems, or stelar systems;
