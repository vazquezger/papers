# Some not too complex thoughts about complexity :)

## Structural Quality

COMPLEXITY is a quality inherent of a system: talks about the system’s structure.
- A system is more or less complex or simple;
- Complexity is a function of the number of components and the number of relationships among components.
- Ok, ok, I know, it is not that simple :)
-- ...  it is also the semantics of the relationships that increases/decreases the system’s complexity.

## Operational Quality
Operational quality refers to the way the system operates at execution time and in the real world.

Operational means many (non exclusive) dimensions like:
- Buildability or how complicated or straightforward is to build a complex or simple the system; 
- Understandability or how simple or complicated to understand a system is;
- Modifiability and how complicated or simple is to change the system structure;  
- You can think also on operational quality in regards to Performance and how the system behaves; not only software system perform bad or well, but think also ablut human systems, or performance about the solar system, or an ant colony.
